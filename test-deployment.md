# Test Deployment Results

## Contract Status
✅ **Contracts Compiled Successfully**
- MockMonToken.sol ✓
- SnakeGameContract.sol (updated) ✓

## New Contract Features
Your updated SnakeGame contract now includes:

1. **Free-to-Play**: No MON tokens required to start games
2. **Reward System**: Players earn 1 MON token for scores ≥ 50
3. **NFT Minting**: Every game awards an NFT to the player
4. **Simplified Flow**: Direct score submission with automatic rewards

## Ready for Deployment

The contracts are ready to deploy to Monad Testnet. To complete the deployment:

```bash
# Set your private key
export PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here

# Deploy contracts
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network monadTestnet
```

## Expected Output
After deployment, you'll receive:
```
MockMonToken Address: 0x...
SnakeGame Address: 0x...
```

Set these as environment variables:
```bash
export VITE_MON_TOKEN_ADDRESS=0x...
export VITE_SNAKE_GAME_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x...
```

## Balance Fix Summary
The "insufficient MON tokens" issue was caused by:
1. Contracts not being deployed yet
2. Frontend trying to check balance on non-existent contracts

With your new contract:
- Games are **free to play** (no MON required upfront)
- Players **earn MON rewards** for high scores (50+)
- Every game mints an **NFT reward**
- Balance checking will work once contracts are deployed

## Test Without Deployment
For immediate testing, the frontend now shows clear error messages when contracts aren't available, and the game can run in demo mode.
